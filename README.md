Game made by @omnitrogen & @tanguymartinez

**The game is still under development!**

2 players / 2 gameplays:
* 1 researcher, CLI
* 1 simulated human, GUI

"A researcher managed to simulate intelligence via his computer, creating a whole world made of 0s and 1s. A cleansing-resistant human remains in his computer. The researcher has no visual on the human. However, he has access to the Saint CLI, the Saint Command Line Interface. He can issue commands and spawn all different kinds of monsters and traps in the simulated world to get rid of the last human. On the other side, the simulated human somehow feels like he has encountered Satan, because the simulated >world he leaves in seems real to him; and in fact it is."

To be continued...
